**Pitch**

**Data**

In this project, we will utilize the following two datasets:

_Built Units Since 2010 from the City of Seattle GIS Program_
- This data was collected by a member of the City of Seattle GIS Program. It was first published on January 5, 2020, and was most recently updated on April 11, 2023. The website does not contain information about how the data was collected.
- We accessed and downloaded this data at the following URL: https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::built-units-since-2010/explore?location=47.614500%2C-122.330455%2C12.00&showTable=true. 
- This dataset has 18505 observations and 57 features. 

_Table B02001 from the U.S. Census_
- This data was collected by the U.S. Census Bureau, which uses data from censuses, surveys, and administrative data (data from U.S. government agencies and occasionally commercial entities). This dataset contains information (count data) about the racial makeup of King County at the block group level. 
- We accessed and downloaded this data at the following URL: https://data.census.gov/table?q=table+b02001&g=050XX00US53033$1500000&tid=ACSDT5Y2020.B02001. 
- On the Census website, we filtered the dataset to only display information for block groups in King County for all the years between 2013 and 2020. For each year, there are 42 features; however, the number of observations varies ‒ from 2013-2019, there are 1422 observations, and for 2020, there are 1545 observations.

**Background Research**

In our research, we found the articles listed below. Here, we discuss how our project builds upon or extends prior ideas and discoveries.

_"Watching Chinatown's Gentrifying/Generational Change" by Shaun Kuo_
- URL: https://www.theurbanist.org/2022/06/14/kuo-%E9%83%AD-watching-chinatowns-gentrifying-generational-change/ 
- Kuo examines census data for age, income, and race in Chinatown for 2010 and 2020. Through his data analysis, he reveals that the dominant age group in Chinatown has shifted from elderly to young folks, the median income in the neighborhood has doubled, and the East Asian population has increased.
- In his discussion of gentrification in Chinatown, Kuo does not directly utilize data about new building developments, which we will do. 
- Our project will also contrast change in Chinatown to Wallingford, a predominantly white neighborhood, which may reveal new insights about gentrification in neighborhoods with different racial makeups.

_"Race, Immigration, and Gentrification in Seattle, 1970-2013" by David Luberoff_
- URL: https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/race-immigration-and-gentrification-in-seattle-1970-2013
- Luberoff discusses findings from Jackelyn Hwang’s article “Gentrification without Segregation? Race, Immigration, and Renewal in a Diversifying City.”
