  p("Gentrification results from migration of affluent people into areas that have
  historically been home to Black, indigenous, and other people of color, which displaces
  those original residents. Developers and corporations often claim 
  that gentrification increases the quality of life within target neighborhoods; however, 
  in reality, it can also lead to a loss of culture, history, and feelings of connection 
  between community members.  And, not only does gentrification impact culture, it threatens 
  the food and housing security of existing residents in gentrifying areas who may not 
  be able to afford increasing rent and food prices (Fogel)."),
  
  h2("Why Seattle, and why the CID and Wallingford?"),
  p("When discussing gentrification, it is important to recognize the ongoing displacement
    in Seattle, the third most quickly gentrifying city in the United States after Washington, D.C.
    and Portland (Fogel). An example of a gentrifying neighborhood in Seattle is the 
    Chinatown-International District (CID), which has a history dating back to the beginning
    of the twentieth century (UW), has been identified as one of the neighborhoods facing the
    most risk of displacement (Kuo). With its rich history and cultural presence in Seattle,
    displacement of the CID would result in the loss of culture and community along with homes and 
    local businesses. Additionally, Wallingford (a North Seattle neighborhood that has close proximity
    to Lake Union and the University District) has faced gentrification in recent history â€’ after the 
    Boeing slump in the late twentieth century, the prices of Wallingford homes rapidly increased (Dorpat).
    The rising home and living prices would have likely led to the displacement of preexisting residents 
    in the area."),
  p("We can see that both Wallingford and the CID have been impacted by gentrification. There is, however,
    a key difference between the two neighborhoods: Wallingford is predominantly white, while
    the CID is not (Niche). This difference suggests that the gentrification faced in both neighborhoods 
    is not equal; therefore, in our project, we will explore and compare gentrification in the Chinatown-International
    District and Wallingford for the years 2013-2020."),
